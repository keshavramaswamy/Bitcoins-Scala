PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

The project uses Scala and the actor model to generate bitcoins, using the given input. The program takes as input, the number of leading zeros the bitcoins are required to have. The bitcoins are mined with the help of SHA-256 algorithm and the input string with the corresponding SHA-256 hash is printed. Further the program is implemented as a distributed system where the computer address of the server is taken as argument.The server mines coins independently but can also accomodate remote workers. The ratio of CPU TIME to REAL TIME is used as a metric to measure the performance based on which the work unit size was chosen.The code was also tested for the largest number of machines it can run on.
